## Release or unassign your IP addresses

You can do this by clicking on the server with the IP address you wish to manage, go to __Servers__ > __Manage__ and click on a server.

Click on the __Network__ tab and in the __Public IP__ field, you should see your IP address along with a blue button and red button


You can choose to either: 

	* Release the IP address (This sends the IP back into the public pool for another customer to use)

	* Unassign the IP address (This keeps the IP in your account to be attached to another server later)


_Note: All unassigned IP addresses will continue to incur usage fees. Please check the [Pricing](https://ninefold.com/pricing/) page to see what you will pay per IP address._
