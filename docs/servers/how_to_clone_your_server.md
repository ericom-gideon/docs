## Clone your server

1. Click on __Servers__ > __Manage__ from the navigation menu.

2. Click the server you would like to clone.

3. Click the dropdown next to your server's status, and select __Clone__.

4. Enter a name for your new server and click __Build Server__.

	_The server creation process will take a few minutes, many minutes if you have lots of data on your server and longer if you have additional volumes attached to your original server._
	
5. Your server is now cloned.
 
	_The Clone function will only clone a server into the same region._
	
	_Also, please raise a support ticket in the Ninefold Portal for any attached data disks to be cloned for you._ We have improvements coming soon that will do this for you.
