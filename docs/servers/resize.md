## Resize your server

1. Click the server from the dashboard you wish to resize.
2. From the overview tab click resize. 
3. Select your desired compute size from the drop down list then click to initiate the change.

Your server will now stop, update its service offering and return with your desired compute size.

**Note:** You cannot resize a 512MB-X1 service offering. You will need to [create a template](how_to_create_a_template_from_your_server.md) of the machine instead and deploy from the template.
