## Resize your server

If your server needs more Memory or CPU you can use the Service resize feature.

1. Click the server from the dashboard you wish to resize.
2. From the overview tab click the __Resize__ button. A dropdown appears. 
3. Select your desired compute size from the drop down list. Our pricing calculator appears at the bottom of the page to show you the approximate monthly cost (excluding network charges). When you are happy with the selected size click __Resize__ to initiate the change.

Your server will now stop, update its service offering and return with your desired compute size.

**Note:** You cannot resize a 512MB-X1 service offering on _Production_ grade servers. You will need to [create a template](how_to_create_a_template_from_your_server.md) of the machine instead and deploy from the template.
