## Servers

#### Does Ninefold block any server ports by default?

When you create a new virtual server, we block all ports by default except the following:

* 22 (SSH) 
* 25 (SMTP)
* 80 (HTTP)
* 443 (HTTPS)

You are able to open / close which ports you require in the firewall rules section of the network tab of your deployed server.

Note: IP Protocol 47 (GRE) is currently blocked and thus any specific applications that rely on this particular protocol (e.g. PTPP VPN) is unable to operate on the new platform at present.

#### How do I setup a reverse DNS (PTR) record for my IP address?

To have a PTR record added for an IP address you are using, you simply need to file a ticket with the following information:

* Virtual machine name
* External IP address (e.g. 103.7.x.x)
* FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) you wish to associate with the IP address (e.g. mx.mydomain.com)
* Reason (e.g. My mail server requires this ...)

Note: You also should be using the above IP address as a static NAT or the virtual machine will not be identifying itself with the correct IP address. Port forwarding will not work.

#### What is a Ninefold template?

A Ninefold template is a Ninefold created and vetted virtual server image, consisting of a specific operating system and configuration.

You also have the ability to create your own templates, based on any of your existing running virtual servers.

#### What time standard does Ninefold use?

As our virtual servers are completely unmanaged, you can set the clock to the time and timezone of your choosing.

#### What are these XEN Tools your support team speak of?

Citrix XEN Tools are a software component added to our templates to ensure smooth operation on our cloud. They help with many functions you use via our portal to interact with your server such as adding/removing a disk or rebooting your server. If you have brought your own OS over (ISO or Template) to Ninefold, please install these tools, they can found over at http://pub.ninefold.com for your consumption.
