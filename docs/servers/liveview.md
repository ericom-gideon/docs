## Access a server with Live View

Live View offers immediate access to a server via the Ninefold portal. It's intended use is for first boots of servers from ISOs or templates, or as a fallback mechanism.

Live View can be particularly helpful if:

* you are unable to get access to a server via traditional means such as SSH or RDP
* you have not assigned a public IP address or port forwarding rules to a server

To access a server via Live View you'll need to know the server's username and password since SSH keys cannot be used with Live View.

1. From the Ninefold portal dashboard, click the server you wish to access.
2. From the server's Overview tab, click on the screen image in the Access / Live View section.

A popup now displays with the server's console. You can interact with the console using standard input devices.
