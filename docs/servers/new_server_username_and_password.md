## New server username and password

So you've successfully created a bare server and now you want to log into it so you can add all sorts of goodies to it. Question is: what is your username and password?

_Note: The information below applies only to Ninefold provided templates._

#### Default usernames

__Windows__: administrator

__CentOS / Fedora / Debian__: root

__Ubuntu__: user (you can use sudo to elevate your permissions)

#### Default passwords

__Linux__: When a new server is created a password is generated and displayed during the build process and is also sent to you via email. 

__Windows__:  Depending on the windows distribution the password will either be set during the first boot or emailed to you.


If you don't receive the email, please check your spam folder. 

We recommend you change default passwords as soon as possible to protect your security.
