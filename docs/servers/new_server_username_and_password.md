## New server username and password

### Overview

So you've successfully created a bare server and now you want to log into it so you can add all sorts of goodies to it. Question is: what is your username and password?

_Note: The information below applies only to Ninefold provided templates._

#### Default usernames

__Windows__: administrator

__CentOS / Fedora / Debian__: root

__Ubuntu__: user (you can use sudo to elevate your permissions)

#### Default passwords

__Linux__: When a new server is created a password is generated and displayed during the build process and is also sent to you via email. 

__Windows__:  The password is set during the first use of this server - there is no default password.

If you don't receive the email, please check your spam folder. 

We recommend you change default passwords as soon as possible to protect your security.
