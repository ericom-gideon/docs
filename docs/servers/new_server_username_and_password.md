## New server username and password

Ninefold has a convention for usernames and passwords which applies to all _Ninefold provided templates_.

#### Default usernames

__Windows__: administrator

__CentOS / Fedora / Debian__: root

__Ubuntu__: user (you can use sudo for elevated root privileges, but you'll need the 'user' password to do so)

#### Default passwords

__Linux__: When a new server is created a password is automatically generated and configured against the default user on the server. The password is sent to you via email.

__Windows__:  Depending on the windows image you created your server from, the password will either be emailed to you or set by you on first boot (you can use Live View to set it).


If you don't receive the password email, please check your spam folder.

We recommend you change default passwords as soon as possible to protect your security.
