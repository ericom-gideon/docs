## Resetting you server password

There may be a point in time where you will need to reset the password. If your Virtual Machine was created from a Ninefold provided template (and isn't a Windows machine), this can be easily achieved by:

* Select your server in the portal
* Select the __Options__ tab
* Select the __Reset Password__ button
* Your server will reboot and email you a new password
 

However, if your virtual machine does not support the Password reset feature (e.g. Created from an ISO, Windows machine or an older template without password reset support) this option will not be available to you. 

__It is important to note that Ninefold does not have access to any of the passwords generated or any passwords you have decided to use on your virtual machine.__



## Windows Servers

A question that can come up is, "I've lost my Windows Server Password, are you sure I can't get it reset somehow?".

We understand that in extreme circumstances, passwords can get misplaced or people leave a company and don't pass on certain information leaving you in a bad position. 

There are ways to reset the Windows Server password using certain applications, we have compiled a list below.
