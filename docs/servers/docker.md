## Docker containers on Ninefold

When you deploy a server, you have the option to deploy one with Docker preloaded.

Simply choose the Docker __Image__ in the server deployment wizard and we will automatically setup Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Docker for you.

If you are new to Docker, we suggest running through the examples in the [Docker tutorial](https://www.docker.com/tryit/). 

You can manage your Docker server like you would any other server by having SSH keys installed, sending through User Data, adding Addition Disk and more.
