## Creating additional users

Creating additional users will allow others in your organization to create and manage both servers and applications in your Ninefold account. Before you can add an additional user you will need to ensure that you're an admin of the account.

1. Access your account details from the dropdown in the upper right corner.
2. Click on the users tab.
3. Click on Create user.
4. Fill in the form with the details for your new user.


The email address for the new user you have entered will receive an activation email that must be clicked before the new user can login. It will also ask them to set their password for the first time.
