## Billing FAQ

#### How does it even work?

We aim to keep the billing process as simple as possible for you.  At the end of each month (typically a couple of days after) we will email you an invoice for the total usage of that month.  This will detail what and how much you used.  If you have any questions or queries on the invoice, please contact us at billing@ninefold.com or raise a ticket and we will be more than happy to help

We give you 48 hours after you receive your invoice to check your usage and confirm there are no anomalies.  If we do not hear from you within the 48 hours, we will process the invoiced amount using the credit card that you provided.  It really is that easy.  We notify you on the successful payment. 

You can update your credit card details at any time from the portal.

If for any reason you are unable to make the payment on the invoiced amount, please contact us.  We are very happy to help and ensure your services are provided uninterrupted.

## Estimates and payments

#### How much will I pay?

Ninefold provides you with multiple ways to estimate what you will pay.  We provide you with a detailed calculator on our pricing page. We also have an automatic estimator in the portal once you create an account that will provide you updated estimates.  Finally, if you are an excel guru you can model your own estimates on your usage by referencing the numbers on our pricing details page.  Of course, we are always happy to help via chat or email to our billing team.

#### A couple of things to remember:

As much as we would like to provide you with completely accurate costs in advance, because we allow you to increase, change, decrease, etc your usage in real time, we cannot lock in an accurate estimate. You can however see unit pricing on our website.

All of our estimates are based on 730 hours in a month: the mythical 30.4167 days.  If you have an issue with months having different days, please lodge your complaints with the Astronomer Monks that Pope Gregory commissioned in 1582.  Please copy us on your correspondence, our initial inquiries were met by dead ears.

Bandwidth â€¦ we do not include outbound data transfers in any of our estimates.  Why?  Our analysis (yes, there is a blog post here somewhere) showed that this is notoriously difficult to model, assess or predict. Our experience shows that data only represents single digit percentage of total costs and we offer significant price breaks on data costs if you know the amount you are likely to use.  Please raise a ticket to take advantage of these discounts.
Our calculators, tables, estimators do NOT include any sales taxes we are required to charge.  Therefore the prices exclude any GST, VAT, Federal or State Sales taxes. These will be applied to your invoice as applicable.


#### How accurate are the calculators on the website and the portal?

Without creating a time machine (it's in the backlog somewhere) we provide you with the most accurate estimates of your usage bearing in mind the points above.

#### What are the prices I see on the website?

The prices in the website and the portal are all in AUD ex GST

#### Can I pay by another method besides credit card?

Ninefold reviews requests for non-credit card billing on a case by case basis.  Any non-credit card paying client will be subject to credit checks, pre-payment requirements, and a strict credit policy.  Please contact sales@ninefold.com or sales chat to discuss this further.

## Currency and Tax

#### Do I pay sales taxes or GST?

If applicable, then yes we apply sales taxes, GST, or VAT to your bill.  This is in addition to the costs we estimate as not all customers are required to pay the various taxes.  If you believe you have been charged in error for taxes, please contact billing@ninefold.com and we will address it.
Payment types


## Estimates, Invoices, Payments, oh my!

We provide you with as much insight into your usage, costs, and billing as possible.

From the outset, we have provided you an estimation calculator for basic configurations on the website.

Once you create an account and can access the portal, we provide you with real-time estimates reflecting the configurations you are looking to deploy.  This is all visible prior to committing any resources or charges.

At the end of the month, prior to any billing activity, we email you your invoice.  This invoice and recent invoices are also available online.

Finally, we will apply a payment against the credit card you have provided us equal to the amount on your invoice.
