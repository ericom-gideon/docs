## Support Policy
Hey, we're Ninefold support! We love helping solve issues and getting our customers' servers up and running. We're here to help and enjoy helping our customers become and remain successful. Here are some things to help us help you.

#### TL;DR
* __Documentation__: http://help.ninefold.com Hey you're looking at it!
* __Tickets__: The best way to contact us for any problems.
* __Chat__: Available when you see a "Chat with us" button!
* __Email__: Please use the ticketing system to have your issue seen and resolved.
* __Phone__: Speak with our friendly team.

#### Documentation
We try to keep our docs up-to-date as possible. These are hosted on Github, so you can totally submit a pull request. If you'd like a doc on something in particular, let us know and we'll put one up as well! We love documentation. :)

We highly recommend reviewing our docs before initiating a chat or logging a case.

#### Tickets
Support issues can be submitted 24x7 via our ticketing system.  These tickets will be answered ASAP and in order during business hours. During non-business hours (weekends and holidays) tickets are triaged and monitored for wider platform/infrastructure issues.

When submitting tickets for app issues, please put in as much information as you can, such as server name, what steps you took to try to troubleshoot, what logs you checked etc.

Don't know how to log a ticket? Check it out [here](http://help.ninefold.com/reference/faq/#how-do-i-log-a-support-ticket).

#### Chat
Livechat is a very convenient way to get simple questions answered, whether it be platform related or sales related. Technical support is available between 8am to 5pm AEST Mon-Fri for general support & sales enquiries. When available, a "Chat with us" option is available on the ninefold.com domain.

Please know that we'll do everything we can to help over chat, but sometimes a ticket will help us save you time and allow us to keep track of what's going on. Feel free to ask away on chat and we'll let you know if a ticket makes more sense.

#### Email
We are best suited to help out over chat or support tickets as we do not actively monitor email. There isn't anything as disheartening as emailing support but not ever receiving a reply. :(

#### Phone
If your ticket is of high severity (i.e. you are experiencing unexpected downtime) please raise a ticket and contact 1300 045 614 (+61 2 8221 7745 if dialing from outside Australia), quoting your ticket number and our team will ensure it is looked at as soon as possible.

## Monitoring

#### Servers
As our server offering is unmanaged, it is the customer's responsibility to configure any rescources and ensure that the individual server is correctly setup and secured.

Our Ninefold platform and infrastructure is monitored 24x7 by our engineers as well as a series of automated systems. However, it is the customerâ€™s responsibility to configure monitoring. We recommend Pingdom & New Relic.

## Platform Status
We provide up-to-date notification of incidents & upcoming maintenance via http://status.ninefold.com. Customers can subscribe to the status system to be kept abreast of any issues.

## Billing
Technical issues surrounding the billing functions on portal should be logged via the ticketing system. More information about Billing can also be found in our [help docs](http://help.ninefold.com/billing/faq/).

Enquiries regarding invoices and payment should be directed to billing@ninefold.com.
