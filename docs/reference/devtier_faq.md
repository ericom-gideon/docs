## Ninefold Dev tier FAQ


#### What is it ?

The Dev tier is great for dev or proof of concept environments. Maybe you just want to play around with something for a while. No matter what the plan, youâ€™ll have a fast, steady dev environment at your fingertips.

When your app or website begins to scale up, move onto Ninefold's production grade infrastructure.


#### What's the difference ?

We have a nice, easy to read table [here](http://ninefold.com/dev-tier-vs-production/)

#### How can i tell if my server is a 'Dev Tier' Server?
All Dev Tier servers have a distinct yellow "DEV" tag visible in the portal in both the dashboard and server overview pages


#### Can i migrate an existing Production server to the Dev Tier?

Due to the nature of Dev Tier instances they can only be deployed new, there is no way to move/convert your existing production server down to the Dev Tier Hardware. 

#### Can i migrate an existing Dev Tier server to your Production grade servers?

When you are done with testing and development, we reccomend deploying new Production grade server/s and moving your configuration across using your Ninefold supplied private network. 

#### Who do i contact for support? 

You still get access to our friendly local support team, specific support differences are listed [here](http://ninefold.com/dev-tier-vs-production/)
