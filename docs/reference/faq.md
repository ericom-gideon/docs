## General

#### How do I check the status of the Ninefold platform?

You can view service availability and upcoming maintenance plans at [status.ninefold.com](http://status.ninefold.com).

The status page is updated at the start and finish of any maintenance period as well as during any platform interruption.

We recommend that you log a support ticket if you experience availability or performance issues in addition to checking the service health page.


#### How do I log a support ticket?

Log into your Ninefold account and select the drop down under your username (top right hand corner of the window).

Select tickets from the drop down list then choose new ticket.

Choose a category that we can help you with then populate the subject and description fields with content relating to your issue or query. You have the option to include a contact phone number (don't forget your area code!). Click the create ticket button.

Once your ticket has been submitted you will see it every time you visit it the support tab.

By clicking on an open ticket you are able to review comments from our support team, add additional comments or close the ticket.

#### Can you help with non-standard support requests?

In some cases you may request that the Ninefold team perform a function or service which is not part of our standard offering.
